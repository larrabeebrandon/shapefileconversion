# shape file conversion
<br>
 Data Introduction: 
<br>
This shapefile was downloaded from data.gov and is the outline of the United States. I converted the file to a .json file and then used the website [Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.com) to simplify the shape. Simplifying the shape removed the complexity of the lines. This reduces the size of the file because it doesn't have to store so many data points. The downside is that the shape becomes more unrecognizable the more you simplify it. As you can see in the table the simplified file is 1/24 the size but if you look at them you can't really tell that it's supposed to be the United States.
